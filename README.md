## How does it work?
Since I knew just a little bit about software engineering I knew that this was possible. In the client side you are in control, so then you could techinically simulate that you are not online by intercepting some types of websockets, the server would never know. 
The challenge was to implement it, happy that I did it!   
Big thanks to [whatsapp-web-incognito](https://github.com/tomer8007/whatsapp-web-incognito) who gave me a huge sense of direction for this project.
